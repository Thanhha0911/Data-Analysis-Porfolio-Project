---Which branch has the most invoice and earn the most money?

	(CAST(Number_invoice AS float)/CAST((SELECT sum(number_invoice) FROM comparision) AS float)*100) as Per_Invoice
FROM comparision
ORDER BY Branch
--->> ABOUT REVENUE, BRANCH C IS THE HIGHEST ONE BUT BRANCH C HAS THE LOWEST NUMBER OF INVOICE 



--- Percentage of total sale value by gender
WITH Gender_segment as(
	SELECT
		Gender,
		SUM(total) as Total_gender

	GROUP BY Gender
)
SELECT Gender,
		ROUND((Total_gender/(SELECT SUM(Total_gender) FROM Gender_segment))*100,0) As per_by_gender
FROM Gender_segment ---/=> We get results with almost the same ratio of value between male and female


--- Check whether if the sale value from member is higher than normal
WITH Customer_type as(

		ROUND((Total_customer_type/(SELECT SUM(Total_customer_type) FROM Customer_type))*100,0) As per_by_customer

---- How many values does each product_line contribute to the total?
WITH Product as(
	SELECT

----What day of the week does the supermarket have the most customers?
SELECT

	AVG(Total) as AVG_Value

		CAST (Payment_date AS datetime) as P_date,
		DATENAME (Weekday,payment_date) as Dayofweek,
		Total
	FROM P1..supermarket) as by_day
GROUP BY Dayofweek
ORDER BY Avg_Value DESC
----> Customers tend to go to the supermarket on weekends the most.Monday and Wednesday have the lowest number of visitors of the week


----- Distribution of visitors by timeframe in a day
SELECT
	Start_time, End_time,
	count(*) as numberofcustomer
FROM (SELECT 
	time,
	CAST(CONVERT(VARCHAR(2), time, 120) AS INT) as Start_time,
	CAST(CONVERT(VARCHAR(2), time, 120) AS INT) + 1 as End_time
	FROM P1..supermarket) As A
GROUP BY Start_time, End_time
ORDER BY Start_time ----=> 19:00 to 20:00 is the time when the most customers come to the supermarket

--- CACULATE NPS SCORE FOR EACH BRANCH

		FROM (
				SELECT 
				Branch,
				NPS,
				Votes,
				SUM(Votes) OVER (PARTITION BY BRANCH) as Total_vote
				FROM NPS_SCORE ) AS NPS_PER
)
	SELECT
	a.Branch, a.NPS, a.NPS_Per, b.NPS, b.NPS_Per,
	a.NPS_Per - b.NPS_Per as Sub
	FROM
	(SELECT * FROM NPS_TABLE

	JOIN
	(SELECT * FROM NPS_TABLE
	WHERE NPS = 'Detractors') b ON a.Branch = b.Branch
	ORDER BY a.Branch

	----> Branch B has the lowest NPS Score in the group
